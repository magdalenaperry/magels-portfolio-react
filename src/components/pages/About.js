        <p className="col-12 text-center px-5 par-spacing pb-5">
          I am a twenty-seven year old woman living in <strong>Charlotte, North Carolina</strong>.
          I am an alumna of <strong>Salem College</strong>, where I earned degrees in <strong>Biology</strong> and 
          <strong>Political Science</strong>.
          I taught high school biology and environmental sciences in Winston Salem, NC for four years.
          I am currently focusing on <strong>learning full stack</strong> coding to become a software developer.
          Web development is quickly becoming a passion of mine; coding encompasses all the things I love: 
          <strong>puzzles</strong>, creative problem solving, <strong>modern art</strong>, design, and attention to detail.
          My time away from learning code includes playing <strong>golf</strong>, reading, cooking, baking, gardening, and playing <strong>Destiny 2</strong>.
          I am currently reading <em>"Clash of Kings"</em> and <em>"The Sea is My Brother"</em> and watching <em>Archer</em>.
